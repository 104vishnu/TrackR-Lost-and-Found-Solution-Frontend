          Have you lost something on campus? Don't worry! Our Lost Items section is where you can list the items you've lost.
          Provide details about the lost item and leave contact information so that if someone finds it, they can get in touch with you.

          It's a community effort to ensure that lost items find their way back to the right hands.
